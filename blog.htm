            So I have read all your comments on instagram asking for specific content so like the fairy god mother I am
            I have come to grant my chidren their ultimate wish. Q&A time! I have taken 2 questions from my insta feed
            to answer my loyal subjects lmao. Q: What is your favortie thing about doing your makeup? A: i would have to
            say how creative I can get with my looks sometimes I wake up with an eye look in my head and that is
            literally
            the first thing i get up to do. (After preping my skin of course) Q: If you can only do a 3 thinsg on your
            face
            for the rest of your life what would it be? A: It would have to be foundation, lashes, and lipgloss.
            Foundation
            becuase I havent grown confident in my looks to do a makeup look without it. I defintley go out without
            makeup often
            but I just need foundation if I am about to do a look. Lashes because lets be honest.... lashe smake
            everything better.
            Lastly, Lip gloss because I am a feen for glossy lips make me look like a 90s music R&B video PLEASE!

            Let's just get to the point ladies I LOVE the ordinary and their products. They are helping me build my
            confidence and the perception I have of myself. Although, I know what you're all going to say. " OMG you
            should just love yourself for who you are!"... blah
            blah blah. Yeah I am hearing that an all but I also want to take better care of myself so I dont always feel
            so drowsy throough out the day and look half
            dead all the time. Recently I have been drinking tons of water, switching up my skin routine, and taking
            actual vitamins. It's like I am an actual adult with resposibilites
            and work to do. Shocker right. In my defense my skin routine wasn't a routine at all but just my lack of
            attetnion to self care. I am back on track to getting my life together
            smh yall would be so proud of me. But in all seeriousness ladies and gents do not be me actually TAKE ACRE
            OF Y'ALLSEVES or imma have abone to pick with each and every one of
            you.

            I am back ladies with a new post by yours truly. I know you all miss me there is no need to cry I am here
            for you my beatuiful children.
            So it has been a WHOLE month since our last chat. So...... How is everyone doing lol! Well I wanted to give
            you an update on the Lactic acid by
            the b=rand 'The Ordinary'. First off I don't want to just reccommend just any product to you all as
            everyone's skin is different. I know I suffer
            from prominent acne scars that bother me I wanted to test this product out. Just be aware that your skin may
            react differently to the prodcut than mine.
            Secondly, I have a confession to make........... I did not use the product as consistently as I wanted to.
            The lack week and a half I fell off my regimine.
            Im sorry ya'll I really played myself. But in my few weeks of using their products I have noticed a chnange
            in the health of my skin. I look lke an actual human
            being instead of a walking zombie lol. Some of the sacrs of my face have faded and I havent seen any new
            acne spots come up in weeks. I see the progress my face
            is much brighter. Curently on my perception of myself new blogger in the making. Until next time!

            Today I did not have any motivatoin to pull together a whole makeup fpr yall.
            Sorry for the disappointment lovelies but I am just not in the greatest of moods today.
            Its like eevrything that can go wrong just does UGH! But anyways I have been recently using these
            amaxing products that I wanted to share with you all. Under all that Glam or 'natural' makeup it is a MUST
            that we take care of gorgeous skin. I present to you the greatest gift of all...... The ordinary !! Dun dun
            dun!!!
            I am so dramatic somestimes lmao. However I have recently been using the lactic acid product from the brand
            'The Ordinary'.
            I fell in love with their products while in London studying abroad and since my skin wants to act up and get
            crazy on me
            back here in the states I went to look assistence. I use Lactic Acid to treat my Acne scars. So far so great
            ! I will update you ladies in
            my next post and give my full critics. Until next time peoples :)
