    <p> Hi everyone! Welcome to Kay Way, a site I created to showcase my Makeup looks.
        I enjoy recreating some of my favorite Youtubers’ look but with my own twist. I’ve been into makeup for a few
        years now
        and have been experimenting with colors and creative looks. I am always looking for new products to try as you
        can see from
        my current makeup collection. However, I have been experimenting with skin care products trying to find what
        works for me and
        would love to share my experiences with you all! Visit my blog to see what’s going on with me and Thank you for
        supporting my content.
        P.S check out a video of my favorite Youtuber below. She inspires me always!</p>
